## Game Details
Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their symbol (either an "X" or an "O") in an empty cell on the grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all the cells on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
